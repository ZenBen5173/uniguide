# UniGuide

**AI-driven workflow assistant for university administrative procedures.**
Built for **UMHackathon 2026**, Domain 1 — AI Systems & Agentic Workflow Automation.

UniGuide reads a student's free-text intent, plans a personalised workflow from the official UM SOP using **Z.AI's GLM**, walks the student through it adaptively, and pre-digests submissions for staff. Pull GLM out and the app collapses to a static form filler — that's the design.

## ⚡ Quick start (for teammates)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ and npm 10+
- Supabase account (free tier is fine) — for Postgres + auth + storage
- Z.AI account with GLM API key — get one at https://z.ai → API Platform
  - **Optional for early dev:** the GLM client has a `mock` mode that returns canned fixtures from `tests/fixtures/glm/` so the app runs without a live key.

### 1 — Install
```bash
npm install
```

### 2 — Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Open `.env` and fill in:
- `ZAI_API_KEY` (or leave blank + set `GLM_MOCK_MODE=true` for offline dev)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (from Supabase dashboard → Project Settings → API)

### 3 — Set up the database
Apply the migrations to your Supabase project. From the Supabase dashboard:
- SQL Editor → paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql` → run.
- Same for `0002_pgvector_kb.sql`, `0003_rls_policies.sql`, `0004_seed_procedures.sql`.

(Or use the Supabase CLI: `npx supabase db push` if you've linked the project.)

### 4 — Seed the knowledge base
```bash
npm run seed:kb
```
This reads each `lib/kb/seed/*.md` file, splits into chunks, and writes to `procedure_sop_chunks`. Re-run any time you edit the seed markdown.

### 5 — Run the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000.

## 🎬 Demo flow

1. **Open the landing page** — http://localhost:3000
2. **Click "Start a workflow"** → http://localhost:3000/student/intake
3. **Type:** *"i need to do industrial training next sem at TechCorp Sdn Bhd"*
4. **Click Continue.** GLM extracts the intent, creates a workflow row, and generates the workflow plan. You're redirected to the canvas view.
5. **Watch the canvas render** — stages, decision nodes, end nodes. The active stage is highlighted.
6. **Click through the steps** — fill in fields, upload a (mock) offer letter, etc.
7. **At the family-owned-company decision node**, GLM evaluates your responses and routes you to the right branch.
8. **Submit the workflow** when all steps are done.
9. **Open the coordinator dashboard** — http://localhost:3000/coordinator/dashboard — to see the GLM-prepared briefing with extracted facts, flags, and recommendation.
10. **Click Approve.** The student's workflow advances; they get a notification.

> 💡 **Mock mode demo:** the canned fixtures support the Industrial Training golden path end-to-end without any real GLM calls. Set `GLM_MOCK_MODE=true` in `.env`.

## 🏗️ Architecture (TL;DR)

```
Browser (Next.js SPA)
  ├─ /student/intake          ← chat-style intent input
  ├─ /student/workflow/[id]   ← canvas + step pane
  └─ /coordinator/dashboard   ← briefing queue

Next.js API routes (serverless)
  ├─ /api/intake              ← extractIntent
  ├─ /api/plan                ← planWorkflow + persistPlan
  ├─ /api/workflow/[id]       ← read full workflow state
  ├─ /api/step/[id]           ← record response → tryAdvance
  ├─ /api/admin/queue         ← list pending briefings
  └─ /api/admin/decision      ← approve/reject → advance

GLM Service Layer (lib/glm/)
  ├─ client.ts                ← Z.AI SDK wrapper, mock mode, retry, latency
  ├─ schemas.ts               ← Zod schemas for every endpoint I/O
  ├─ trace.ts                 ← writes glm_reasoning_trace
  ├─ prompts/*.md             ← versioned system prompts
  ├─ extractIntent / planWorkflow / adaptStep / routeDecision
  ├─ parseDocument / generateBriefing
  └─ citationVerifier         ← strips hallucinated regulation refs

Workflow Engine (lib/workflow/)
  ├─ persistPlan              ← GLM plan JSON → DB rows
  └─ stageEngine              ← advance, route at decision nodes

Knowledge Base (lib/kb/)
  ├─ seed/*.md                ← UM procedure SOPs (canonical source for GLM)
  └─ retrieve.ts              ← fetch SOP chunks for a procedure

Supabase (managed)
  ├─ Postgres + pgvector      ← workflows, traces, KB embeddings
  ├─ Storage                  ← uploaded documents (signed URLs)
  └─ Auth                     ← email + magic link
```

See `docs/SAD.md` for full architecture diagrams (component, sequence, ERD, DFD).

## 🔑 Where GLM is load-bearing

| Endpoint | What GLM does | Without GLM |
|---|---|---|
| `extractIntent` | Classifies free-text → procedure_id with confidence | User has to pick from a dropdown |
| `planWorkflow` | Reads SOP + profile → emits stages/edges/decisions | No workflow exists |
| `adaptStep` | Rewords each question for the student's context | Robotic generic forms |
| `routeDecision` | Reasons over actual responses to pick a branch | Regex over form fields, brittle |
| `parseDocument` | Extracts structured fields from PDF/image | Manual data entry |
| `generateBriefing` | Pre-digests submission for the staff reviewer | Staff re-reads raw form |

**Pull GLM out → UniGuide is dead.** This satisfies the hackathon brief.

## ✅ What's done vs TODO (as of submission prep)

### Done
- Project scaffold (Next.js 15 + Tailwind + Supabase + ReactFlow)
- Database schema + RLS + KB tables (4 migrations)
- GLM service layer with mock mode (extractIntent, planWorkflow, routeDecision, adaptStep, parseDocument, generateBriefing)
- Versioned prompts in `lib/glm/prompts/`
- Workflow engine (persistPlan + stageEngine + tryAdvanceWorkflow)
- API routes for intake, planning, step submission, admin queue, admin decision
- UI: landing page, intake chat, workflow canvas, step panel, coordinator dashboard
- KB seed for Industrial Training and Postgrad Admission
- Mock fixtures for the demo flow

### TODO (for final-round polish)
- [ ] Submit endpoint that triggers `generateBriefing` → creates pending admin_briefing
- [ ] Document text extraction (`lib/documents/extractText.ts`) — `pdf-parse` for PDFs, `tesseract.js` for images
- [ ] Structured output bundle generation (PDF form fill, `.ics` calendar, email drafts)
- [ ] Embedding generation in `seed-kb.ts` (currently writes `embedding=null`)
- [ ] Authentication UI (login / signup pages — currently relies on Supabase magic link)
- [ ] Test fixtures for `intent_unknown`, `route_proceed` (only the most common are in)
- [ ] Vitest unit tests for `validateGraph`, `verifyCitations`, schema validators
- [ ] Playwright E2E for the golden path (TC-01 in QATD)
- [ ] Sentry integration
- [ ] Upstash rate limiter wired into `lib/glm/client.ts`
- [ ] Coordinator-side stage view (currently they only see briefings)

## 🛠️ Common dev tasks

### Run type check
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Run tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Re-seed KB after editing SOPs
```bash
npm run seed:kb
```

### Add a new procedure
1. Add it to `lib/glm/schemas.ts` `ProcedureIdSchema`.
2. Add a row to `supabase/migrations/0004_seed_procedures.sql` (or run an INSERT in SQL editor).
3. Drop a markdown file in `lib/kb/seed/{procedure_id}.md` with the SOP content.
4. Run `npm run seed:kb`.
5. Add a mock fixture `tests/fixtures/glm/plan_{procedure_id}.json` for offline testing.
6. Update the heuristic in `lib/glm/extractIntent.ts:pickIntentFixture()` so mock mode picks the right fixture.

### Add a new GLM endpoint
1. Define input/output Zod schemas in `lib/glm/schemas.ts`.
2. Write a system prompt in `lib/glm/prompts/{name}.md`.
3. Create `lib/glm/{name}.ts` following the pattern of `extractIntent.ts`.
4. Always go through `callGlm()` from `client.ts` — never call the OpenAI SDK directly.
5. Always write a trace via `writeTrace()`.
